							Welcome to the main paige on my site.</br>
							On this paige I want to give you a quick introduction of me.</br>
							What for study I do and what for study I have done and of course wich study I still want to do</br>
							</br>
							I started an car mechanic study in Groningen and than moved to Heerenveen.</br>
							I have worked at multiple places in Drachten and in Leeuwarden.</br>
							But the main place I learned to tinker on cars was at Z.W.A.T. also in Drachten.</br>
							After I moved to Leeuwarden and started working there I decided I dont want to do it anymore.</br>
							I wanted something more and completly new challange and make my hobby in to work.</br>
							And that was applying a code school and start to learn code and work as a developer.</br>
							I went back to school and wanted to apply on application and media developer.</br>
							But I didnt had the papers to be alowed and I was redirected to starting in IT.</br>
							This way I developed a good ammount of knowledge about server and hosting and even repair broken laptops.</br>
							Now that I have almost finished the current study I am finally allowed for that next year (2018/2019).</br>
							I will use this site as a personal learning place and if you follow this site more often u will see me grow.
